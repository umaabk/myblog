    <p>My favourite hobby is reading leisurely and informative books full of interest in free time. Whenever I go home from school, after completing my homework, I like to read books like this. I am 12 years old and studying in class 7. Now, I know it well, that reading books is a very good habit, which makes me perfect.<br><br>Reading sharpens your mind and increases your level of understanding of different things in your life. Reading books help to relieve your stress and uncertainty. They give much-needed relief and relaxation to your mind.</p>
